# 🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that focuses on **data analysis, model building, and deployment** to predict house prices in Bangalore based on location and property features.  
The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit Cloud** for real-time predictions.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo
👉 **Streamlit App:**  
https://bangalorehousepriceprediction-prasadshetty.streamlit.app/

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project covers the complete Machine Learning lifecycle:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment using Streamlit

Users can input property details such as:
- Location  
- Total square feet  
- Number of bathrooms  
- Number of balconies  
- BHK configuration  

The application predicts the **estimated house price in Lakhs (₹)**.
